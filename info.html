 <p>What is Mental Health?
 En Español
 Body
 Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.

 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.

 Mental Health Conditions
 Mental illnesses are disorders, ranging from mild to severe, that affect a person’s thinking, mood, and/or behavior. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one-in-five adults live with a mental illness.

 Many factors contribute to mental health conditions, including:

 Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
 Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
 Family history of mental health problems
 Some mental health topics include:

 Antisocial personality disorder
 Anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, and social anxiety)
 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
 Bipolar disorder
 Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
 Depression
 Eating disorders (including Anorexia Nervosa, binge eating Disorder, and Bulimia Nervosa)
 Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
 Schizophrenia
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
 Self-harm
 Suicide and suicidal behavior
 A Serious Mental Illness (SMI) is a mental illness that interferes with a person’s life and ability to function. Despite common misperceptions, having an SMI is not a choice, a weakness, or a character flaw. It is not something that just “passes” or can be “snapped out of” with willpower.

 Early Warning Signs & Symptoms
 Not sure if you or someone you know is living with mental health problems? Experiencing one or more of the following feelings or behaviors can be an early warning sign of a problem:

 Eating or sleeping too much or too little
 Pulling away from people and usual activities
 Having low or no energy
 Feeling numb or like nothing matters
 Having unexplained aches and pains
 Feeling helpless or hopeless
 Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual
 Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared
 Yelling or fighting with family and friends
 Experiencing severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships
 Having persistent thoughts and memories you can't get out of your head
 Hearing voices or believing things that are not true
 Thinking of harming yourself or others
 Inability to perform daily tasks like taking care of your kids or getting to work or school

 Tips for Living Well with a Mental Health Condition
 Having a mental health condition can make it a struggle to work, keep up with school, stick to a regular schedule, have healthy relationships, socialize, maintain hygiene, and more.

 However, with early and consistent treatment—often a combination of medication and psychotherapy—it is possible to manage these conditions, overcome challenges, and lead a meaningful, productive life.

 Today, there are new tools, evidence-based treatments, and social support systems that help people feel better and pursue their goals. Some of these tips, tools and strategies include:

 Stick to a treatment plan. Even if you feel better, don’t stop going to therapy or taking medication without a doctor’s guidance. Work with a doctor to safely adjust doses or medication if needed to continue a treatment plan.
 Keep your primary care physician updated. Primary care physicians are an important part of long-term management, even if you also see a psychiatrist.
 Learn about the condition. Being educated can help you stick to your treatment plan. Education can also help your loved ones be more supportive and compassionate.
 Practice good self-care. Control stress with activities such as meditation or tai-chi; eat healthy and exercise; and get enough sleep.
 Reach out to family and friends. Maintaining relationships with others is important. In times of crisis or rough spells, reach out to them for support and help.
 Develop coping skills. Establishing healthy coping skills can help people deal with stress easier.
 Get enough sleep. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood and overall health. Consistently poor sleep is associated with anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions.</p>
